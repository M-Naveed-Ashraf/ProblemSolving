Rasool, the man who delivers eggs to my home everyday, did not turn up one day. So when he came the next morning I demanded an explanation from him. He told me the following story:
The previous morning when he just came out of the house carrying a basket full of eggs on his head to start his daily rounds and stepped on to the street, a car going full speed brushed against him and knocked down his basket destroying all the eggs. The driver, however, a thorough gentleman admitted his responsibility and offered to compensate him for damages. But Rasool could not remember the exact number of eggs he had, but he estimated the number at between 50 and 100. He was also able to tell the gentleman that if the eggs were counted by 2’s and 3’s at a time, none would be left, but if counted by 5’s at a time, 3 would remain, and that he sold the eggs at 5O paise a piece. The gentleman made some quick calculations and paid Rasool adequately.
How much did the gentleman pay Rasool?
